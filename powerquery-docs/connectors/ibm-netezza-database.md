## Connect to an IBM Netezza database from Power Query Desktop

To connect to an **IBM Netezza** database, take the following steps:

1. Select **Get Data** from the **Home** ribbon in Power BI Desktop.

2. Select **Database** from the categories on the left, select **IBM Netezza** on the right, and then select **Connect**.

3. In the **IBM Netezza** window that appears, type or paste the name of your Netezza server and database into the boxes. You can **Import** data directly into Power BI or you can use **DirectQuery**. Learn more about [using DirectQuery](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery). Then select **OK**.

   For more information about authentication methods, go to [Authentication with a data source](../connectorauthentication.md).

5. After you connect, a **Navigator** window appears and displays the data that's available on the server. Either select **Load** to load the data or **Transform Data** to continue transforming the data in the Power Query editor.


## Connect to an IBM Netezza database from Power Query Online

To connect to an **IBM Netezza** database, take the following steps:

1. Select the **IBM Netezza** option in the connector selection.

2. In **Connect to data source**, provide the name of the server and database.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/ibm-netezza-database/service-signin.png" alt-text="Enter the Netezza database online connection.":::

3. Select the name of your on-premises data gateway.

4. If this is the first time you're connecting to this Netezza database, configure the user name and password for the IBM Netezza authentication.

5. Select **Next** to continue.

6. In **Navigator**, select the data you require, then select **Transform data** to transform the data in the Power Query editor.

## Connect using advanced options

Power Query Desktop and Power Query Online provide a set of advanced options that you can add to your query if needed.

The following table lists all of the advanced options you can set in Power Query Desktop and Power Query Online.

| Advanced option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Command timeout in day.hr:min:sec | Specifies how long to wait for a response when interacting with the Snowflake service before returning an error. Default is no time-out. |
| Command timeout in day.hr:min:sec | Specifies how long to wait for a query to complete before returning an error. Default is no time-out. |
| Normalize database name | Specifies whether to normalize the database name. Default is true. |
| Create hierarchical navigation view | Specifies whether to provide the database navigation in hierarchy view. Default is true. |
| Include relationship columns | Specifies whether to include columns that might have relationships to other tables. Default is true. |

Once you've selected the advanced options you require, select **OK** in Power Query Desktop or **Next** in Power Query Online to connect to your IBM Netezza database.

## Use Netezza ODBC driver (Preview)

The IBM Netezza connector includes a built-in driver for connectivity by default. Starting from the **July 2025 version** of Power BI Desktop and the on-premises data gateway, there's a new option to use the user-installed Netezza ODBC driver to connect to the IBM Netezza database, currently available in preview. It enables you to utilize the native client tool provided by the data source.

To install the driver on the machine running Power BI Desktop or the on-premises data gateway, follow the IBM Netezza instruction from [Installing and configuring ODBC (Windows)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/netezza?topic=odbc-installing-configuring-windows).

To use the user-installed Netezza ODBC driver in Power BI Desktop, navigate to **Options and settings** (under the **File** tab) > **Options** > **Preview features**, and then select the checkbox to enable the **Use user-installed Netezza ODBC driver** option.

:::image type="content" source="media/ibm-netezza-database/pbi-desktop-preview-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the use user-installed Netezza ODBC driver option in Power BI Desktop.":::

To use the user-installed Netezza ODBC driver in on-premises data gateway, update the gateway configurations using the following steps:

1. On the local machine where the on-premises data gateway is installed, navigate to **C:\Program Files\On-premises data gateway**.
2. Make a backup of the configuration file named **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config**.
3. Open the original **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config** configuration file and locate the `MashupUseUserInstalledNetezzaODBCDriver` entry.
4. Update the `MashupUseUserInstalledNetezzaODBCDriver` value as `True`.
5. Restart your gateway.

```xml
<Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.GatewayCoreSettings>
   ...
   <setting name="MashupUseUserInstalledNetezzaODBCDriver" serializeAs="String">
      <value>True</value>
   </setting>
   ...
</Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.GatewayCoreSettings>    
```

Currently, using the user-installed Netezza ODBC driver has the following known limitations:

- "Create hierarchical navigation view" setting is not supported. The connector always provides the database navigation in hierarchy view.
- "Include relationship columns" setting is not supported. Relationships aren't returned. The capability will be added in future release.

The remaining configurations to connect to an IBM Netezza database from Power Query Desktop or Power Query Online are the same as described in the previous sections.
