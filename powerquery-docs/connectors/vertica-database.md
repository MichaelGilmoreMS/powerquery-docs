## Summary

| Item | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Release State | General Availability |
| Products | Power BI (Semantic models)<br/>Power BI (Dataflows)<br/>Fabric (Dataflow Gen2) |
| Authentication Types Supported | Database |
| Function Reference Documentation | &mdash; |

> [!NOTE]
> Some capabilities may be present in one product but not others due to deployment schedules and host-specific capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting from June 2025, the Vertica connector no longer supports cloud connections. If you have such workload, use the on-premises data gateway and install the Vertica ODBC driver to connect to Vertica database. Learn more from [Use user-installed Vertica ODBC driver](#use-vertica-odbc-driver).

## Capabilities Supported

* Import
* DirectQuery (Power BI semantic models)

## Connect to a Vertica database from Power Query Desktop

> [!NOTE]
> Since April 2025 version of Power BI Desktop, you need to [install the Vertica ODBC driver](#use-vertica-odbc-driver) on your machine to use the Vertica database connector.

To connect to an **Vertica** database, take the following steps:

1. Select **Get Data** from the **Home** ribbon in Power BI Desktop.

2. Select **Database** from the categories on the left, select **Vertica** on the right, and then select **Connect**.

3. In the **Vertica** window that appears, type or paste the name of your Vertica server into the box. You can **Import** data directly into Power BI or you can use **DirectQuery**. Learn more about [using DirectQuery](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery). Then select **OK**.

   For more information about authentication methods, go to [Authentication with a data source](../connectorauthentication.md).

5. After you connect, a **Navigator** window appears and displays the data that's available on the server. Either select **Load** to load the data or **Transform Data** to continue transforming the data in the Power Query editor.


## Connect to a Vertica database from Power Query Online

> [!NOTE]
> Since May 2025 version of on-premises data gateway, you need to [install the Vertica ODBC driver](#use-vertica-odbc-driver) on your gateway machine to use the Vertica database connector.

To connect to an **Vertica** database, take the following steps:

1. Select the **Vertica** option in the connector selection.

2. In **Connect to data source**, provide the name of the server.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/Vertica-database/service-signin.png" alt-text="Enter the Vertica database online connection.":::

3. Select the name of your on-premises data gateway.

4. If this is the first time you're connecting to this Vertica database, configure the user name and password for the Basic authentication.

5. Select **Next** to continue.

6. In **Navigator**, select the data you require, then select **Transform data** to transform the data in the Power Query editor.

## Use Vertica ODBC driver

Starting from the February 2025 version of Power BI Desktop and the on-premises data gateway, we provide the capability to use the user-installed Vertica ODBC driver to connect to the Vertica database, which enables you to utilize the native client tool provided by the data source. The previous built-in driver will be deprecated and removed in future releases. Connecting to Vertica database without on-premises data gateway will no longer be supported and and will result in an error since June 2025.

### Install the Vertica ODBC driver

To install the driver on the machine running Power BI Desktop or the on-premises data gateway, follow these steps:

1. Download the Windows version of Vertica ODBC driver from [Client Drivers](https://www.vertica.com/download/vertica/client-drivers/).

2. Open the downloaded .exe to begin the installation process.

3. Select **ODBC driver** under **Vertica Component List**, then select **Next** to start the installation.

### Use Vertica ODBC driver in Power BI Desktop

Since **April 2025 version** of Power BI Desktop, you need to [install the ODBC driver](#install-the-vertica-odbc-driver) on your machine to use the Vertica database connector in Power BI Desktop.

For February and March 2025 version of Power BI Desktop, to use the user-installed Vertica ODBC driver, navigate to **Options and settings** (under the **File** tab) > **Options** > **Preview features**, and then select the checkbox to enable the **Use user-installed Vertica ODBC driver** option.

### Use Vertica ODBC driver in on-premises data gateway

Since **May 2025 version** of on-premises data gateway, you need to [install the Vertica ODBC driver](#install-the-vertica-odbc-driver) on your gateway machine to use the Vertica database connector which provides the latest capability.

If you need to change the driver to use, you can update the value of the corresponding feature name in the gateway configuration file.

| On-premises data gateway version | Feature name                       | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| May 2025 onwards                 | MashupUseEmbeddedVerticaODBCDriver | Setting that determines which driver to use:<br/>- `False` (default): Use the user-installed Vertica ODBC driver.<br/>- `True`: Use the built-in Vertica driver. |
| February, March and April 2025   | UserInstalledVerticaODBCDriver     | Setting that determines which driver to use:<br/>- `False` (default): Use the built-in Vertica driver.<br>- `True`: Use the user-installed Vertica ODBC driver. |
| Earlier versions                 | -                                  | Always use the built-in Vertica driver.                      |

To change the configuration, using the following steps: 

1. On the local machine where the on-premises data gateway is installed, navigate to **C:\Program Files\On-premises data gateway**.
2. Make a backup of the configuration file named **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config**.
3. Open the original **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config** configuration file and locate the feature name entry as specified in the table above, corresponding to your gateway version.
4. Update the value for the feature name.
5. Restart your gateway.

*Example of using the built-in driver in May 2025 version of on-premises data gateway:*

```xml
<Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.GatewayCoreSettings>
   ...
   <setting name="MashupUseEmbeddedVerticaODBCDriver" serializeAs="String">
	   <value>True</value>
   </setting>
   ...
</Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.GatewayCoreSettings>    
```

The remaining configurations to connect to a Vertica database from Power Query Desktop or Power Query Online are the same as described in the previous sections.
